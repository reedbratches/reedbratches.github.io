##### Abstract

###### Background:

Multidisciplinary clinics (MDCs) provide benefits to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and their caregivers, but MDC visits are information-heavy and can last 4 hours, with patients and caregivers meeting with multiple specialists within each MDC visit. There are questions about the effectiveness of current methods of sharing information from MDCs with patients. Video recordings are a promising new method of sharing information that may allow patients and caregivers to revisit the MDC and remind them of clinical recommendations and conversations.

###### Objective:

The objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of sharing information through video recordings of ALS MDC visits with patients and caregivers.

###### Methods:

This study was a randomized, controlled pilot trial with 3 months of follow-up from April 2021 to March 2022 in a rural multidisciplinary neurology clinic. We recruited patients with ALS, their caregivers, and their clinicians. Patients and their caregivers were randomized to either receive their normal after-visit summary (treatment as usual) or to receive their normal after-visit summary and a video recording of their MDC visit (video). Each specialist visit had its own recording and was accessible by patients and caregivers using a secure web-based platform called HealthPAL over a 3-month follow-up period. Primary study outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of the video intervention measured by recruitment rate (target: 70%), percentage of participants watching videos (target: 75%), and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure and Acceptability of Intervention Measure (targets: 3/5). We hypothesized that video recording would be feasible and acceptable to patients and their caregivers.

###### Results:

Of the 30 patients approached, 24 were recruited, while all caregivers (n=21) and clinicians (n=34) approached were recruited. A total of 144 specialist visits were recorded, approximately 12 specialist visits at a median of one MDC visit per patient. Of the recorded patients, 75% (9/12) viewed videos. High median intervention feasibility (4, SD 0.99) and acceptability (4, SD 1.22) of intervention measures were reported by patients and caregivers in the intervention arm. High median intervention feasibility (5, SD 0.21) and acceptability (4.88, SD 0.4) were reported by clinicians. Of the 24 patients, 50% (n=12) did not complete a 3-month follow-up, primarily due to death (n=10).

###### Conclusions:

Video recording is highly feasible and acceptable for patients, caregivers, and clinicians at a rural ALS clinic. Our level of attrition is a useful benchmark for future studies in MDC populations. Despite high rates of patient death, 1-week assessments highlight the value of recordings for both patients and caregivers.
