##### Abstract
<br>
<br>
__Objective__  To understand the perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
healthcare communication with family caregivers.
<br>
<br>
__Design__ Nationally representative survey.
<br>
<br>
__Setting__ USA (national).
<br>
<br>
__Participants__ 340 family caregivers, demographically representative of the US population by
race/ethnicity.
<br>
<br>
__Primary__ outcome measures Communication outcomes (feeling involved by the provider, feeling
involved by the care recipient, feeling more encouraged to be involved in care, feeling
contributory to discussions, feeling questions are being answered), behavioural/wellness
outcomes (feeling anxious, feeling isolated, feeling it is easier to attend the clinic visit), and
desire to continue using telemedicine.
<br>
<br>
__Results__ Having less than a college degree was associated with decreased odds of feeling
involved by the provider (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.83; p=0.01), feeling involved by the care
recipient (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.79; p=0.01), feeling more encouraged to be involved in care
(OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.86; p=0.01), feeling like they contribute to discussions (OR 0.45;
95% CI 0.25 to 0.82; p=0.01) and feeling like their questions are being answered (OR 0.33;
95% CI 0.18 to 0.60; p&lt;0.001).
<br>
<br>
__Conclusion__ In our sample, the shift to telemedicine during COVID-19 was well received but
caregivers of low educational attainment reported poorer health communication, and a greater
proportion of black/African American and Hispanic caregivers reported a desire to return to in-
person visits. There is an opportunity to improve health systems and increase equity as
telemedicine becomes more widespread.
