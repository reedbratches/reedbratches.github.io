##### Abstract

###### Objectives

The clinic visit is a critical point of contact for family caregivers. However, only 37% of family caregivers are able to accompany patients to visits. When they cannot attend, caregivers receive visit information to assist with their caregiving. However, little is known about how method of receiving information from clinic visits is associated with important caregiver outcomes. This study sought to determine whether mode of receiving clinic visit information (speaking with the patient, attending the visit, or using an after-visit summary [AVS]) was associated with changes in caregiver burden, caregiver preparedness, and the positive aspects of caregiving.

###### Methods

Cross-sectional web-based survey of a national sample of adult family caregivers. Multiple linear regression models determined associations between communication modes and caregivers’ burden, preparedness, and positive aspects of caregiving, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates.

###### Results

Respondents (N = 340) were mostly male (58%), White (59%), ranged from 18 to 85 years old, and supported patients with conditions including diabetes, dementia, and cancer. Speaking with patients was associated with increases in positive aspects of caregiving (95% CI = 2.01, 5.42) and an AVS was associated with increases in positive aspects of caregiving (95% CI = 0.4, 3.56) and preparedness for caregiving (95% CI = 0.61, 3.15). Using any method of receiving information from visits was associated with the greatest increase in preparedness, compared to not receiving visit information. We did not observe an association between method of communication and caregiver burden.

###### Significance of results

Method of communicating visit information is associated with improvements in caregiver preparedness and the positive aspects of caregiving, though caregiver burden may be unaffected by information exchange. Given the limitations of current communication methods, future work should explore directionality of the associations we found and identify visit communication strategies with caregivers that optimize caregiver and patient outcomes.
